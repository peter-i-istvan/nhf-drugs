    "## Generating the training, validation and test data\n",
    "\n",
    "The article suggests that the auto-encoder builds a latent representation ($\\textbf{Z}$) based on the $\\textbf{X}$ feature vectors and the $\\textbf{A}$ adjacency matrix, then the decoder (the generative model) predicts $\\textbf{A}$ based on $\\textbf{Z}$, with pairs of vertices whose $\\textbf{z}$ latent representations have a higher inner product being more likely to be connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the prediction is to determine the existence of an edge between any two nodes. Any edge should be in at most one of the *train*, *validation* or *split* sets, otherwise we would have, for example, validation data that was part of the training data as well, defeating the purpose and integrity of the validation set. As a consequence, the best way to split the data is to partition the edges into *train edges*, *validation edges* and *test edges*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model proposed uses graph convolutional layers to extract the latent variables ($\\textbf{Z}$), and graph convolutions use vertex-local structure, with information from vertices closer than $d$ hops, where $d$ is the convolutional filter's size. When selecting samples, these samples should be subgraphs (as opposed to one, or few pairs of nodes per sample, querying wether they are connected or not), to keep some of the valid information about connected-ness intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three-way split defines three separate subgraphs, and the samples will be subgraphs of these. During the split, it is possible that, for example, for some vertex $a$, edge $(a, x)$ is in the *train* split, $(a, y)$ is in *validation* and $(a, z)$ is in *test*, so during training, the majority of the information about the vertex's neighbourhood is lost. We solve this problem by keeping the percentage of *training* edges high, to render this situation unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is also possible that during the sampling of the *training* graph, *training* edges connected to the same vertex get split up across samples, so we reduce the information that the model 'sees', at that particular sample, with respect to that given vertex. This is not necessarily a problem, because this situation can condition the model to be more redundant (in the way a *dropout* layer can condition a model using fully connected layers to be more redundant). However, we will solve this problem, because so far, the feature extraction from the database does not give much to rely on, so neighbourhood and clustering information between interacting molecules can be critical. We will sample a fixed number of vertices from the *training* subgraph first, then we will include all the edges between these vertices that are in the *training* graph - also called an *induced subgraph* (same for the other splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial, that when *loss* is calculated, we should **not penalize** the model for finding an edge that is **not in the *training* sample**, but **is present in the original graph** (the same applies to the *validation* and *test* steps as well). Supppose we have a training sample $(X, y)$, where $X=(G, features)$, $y=G'$, and the model should infer $y$ from $X$. $G$ should be a subgraph of the *training graph* (to keep the integrity of the *train*, *validation* and *test* sets - see the second paragraph of this section), but $G'$ should be the maximal subgraph *of the original graph* that has exactly the same vertices as $G$ (for correctness).\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the principles above, representing the $G$ and $G'$ graphs as a list of edges, we generate the *train*, *validation* and *test* sets as follows:"
